Prevents pawns from stacking when performing any combat duties.

[h3]Technical stuff[/h3]
If a pawn is performing a duty that has the attribute alwaysShowWeapon, they will not be able to share a tile with other pawns. This replaces the periodic check of "is there a hostile in a given radius", resulting in a more predictable experience.

These duties are basically any sort of active participation in hostilities - raiding, sapping, breaching, prison breaks, etc.
